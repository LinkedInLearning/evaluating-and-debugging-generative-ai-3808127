Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are changing how we build AI-powered solutions. In this course, learn the tools needed to evaluate and debug generative AI models while boosting productivity. Instructor Kesha Williams details the tools that help you train, evaluate, debug, trace, and monitor generative AI models. Learn to evaluate and debug LLMs you access via an API, fine-tune yourself, or train from scratch. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of evaluating and debugging models.
